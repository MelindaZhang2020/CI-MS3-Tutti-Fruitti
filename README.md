### **Design**

**_Overall Feel_**

Considering the nature of Smoothies, ie. "fruit" "vegetables" "summer" "ice" "cold" "fresh". The overall feel of this project will be light, cool, refreshing, clean. The user should feel like they are on holiday, by the beach and having a nice cold fruity drink in their hands.

**_Colour Scheme_**

Take from the above feeling, I decide to use below color palatte. ⬇️

**_Typography_**

**_Imagery_**

Imagery is the soul of a website, it plays an very important role of user experience. It should be nice and clear, illustrating the site and recipes. The color scheme of the images should interact with the main color scheme.

### **Wireframes & Mockups**

The initial plan of this project is to use a bootstap template, but as the development progress, it turned out a bit messy. So I decided to ditch the original plan and start it again. You can see a photo or a hand-drawing mockup below. ⬇️

You can also find a balsamiq wireframe [here](static/documentation/wireframe.pdf)

## **Features**

### **Existing Features**

**_Navigation displayed in all pages_**

All the pages will look identical with the same navigation menu displayed at the very top. Depending if a user is logged in or not, the options correspond accordingly. see the chat below for a clearer view. ⬇️

**_Recipes avaliable to all users_**

All recipes are avaliable to all users, so that all users will get to taste what the website is all about, and what they can experience, then decide if they would like to explore more functionalities of the website.

**_Users can search recipes based on either key words or ingredients_**

For smoothies, most people may not familiar with a specific name. The main ingredient or the main liquid is what people look at when it comes to searching. This feature will meet this particular user need.
